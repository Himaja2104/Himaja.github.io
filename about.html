            <p>Hey, my name is Himaja Cherukupally.</p>
            <p>With a background in BBA IT, I developed a keen interest in the field of UX/UI design. My academic journey introduced me to the fundamentals of technology and business, which ignited my passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. I am dedicated to merging usability with aesthetic design to craft digital experiences that not only meet user needs but also delight and engage them.</p>
            <p>As I embark on this exciting career path, I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to meaningful projects. My goal is to continue learning and growing in the UX/UI field, exploring new design trends and techniques to enhance user interactions and create impactful digital solutions.</p>
